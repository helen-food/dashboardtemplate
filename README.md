# dashboardtemplate

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Template for making multi-page dashboards in FSA colours.

## What is it

It is a {golem} project. Some of the initial dev file (`dev/01_start.R`) and 
main dev file (`dev/02_dev.R`) has been run - everything else 
is commented out, to be uncommented/run if necessary. The description metadata 
will need to be customised to the project.

Environment control is set up with {renv}. Snapshots are explicit i.e. only 
packages required to run the app, not development packages.

Testing has been initialised to encourage it ;)

Fonts and colours are controlled via `inst/app/www/custom.css`. 

## To use

This repository is a template - you can create new repos from a template 
(https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) but 
as we can't create repos you'd need to ask for this when requesting the repo.

OR

Clone the repo, then remove and reinitialise Git.
